**Confidence:** High  
**Rationale:** Strong fundamentals (8.4/10) and good technical setup (7.8/10) support investment thesis. Bullish sentiment (0.517) reinforces positive outlook.

**Entry Strategy:**

**For Long-Term Investors:**
- Current price ($190.53) acceptable given strong fundamentals (8.4/10)
- Bullish sentiment (0.517) supports long-term thesis
- Consider dollar-cost averaging if entering now
- Entry range: $167.02-$194.34 (-12.3% to 2.0% from current)

**For Tactical Traders:**
