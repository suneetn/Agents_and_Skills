## Investment Recommendation

**For Tactical Traders:**
- Wait for pullback to $472.12-$481.56 support zone (-3.2% discount)
- OR wait for breakout above $535.64 with volume confirmation
- Avoid entering at current levels without technical confirmation

**Exit Strategy:**
- **Target 1:** $535.64 (9.8% upside) - Near-term resistance level (Technical Resistance)
- **Stop Loss:** $462.68 (below key support at $472.12) - Risk management
- **Trailing Stop:** If position moves favorably, trail stop below key support levels
