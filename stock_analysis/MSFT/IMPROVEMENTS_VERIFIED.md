## ✅ All Improvements Verified

### 1. Alignment Logic Fixed ✅

**Before (Old Report):**
- Line 136: "Divergence - Bullish sentiment but weak fundamentals/technicals"

**After (New Report):**
- Line 140: **"Divergence - Bullish sentiment and strong fundamentals, but weak technicals"**

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED** - Now correctly identifies Microsoft has **strong fundamentals** (7.4/10)

---

### 2. Technical Interpretation Added ✅

**Before (Old Report):**
- No technical interpretation section
- Just listed indicators without explanation

**After (New Report):**
- Lines 98-100: **New "Technical Interpretation" section** added
- Explains: "Short-term downtrend within longer-term uptrend. Price remains above SMA 200..."
- Adds context: "Given strong fundamentals (score: 7.4/10), short-term technical weakness may present buying opportunities for long-term investors."

**Status:** ✅ **ADDED** - Technical section now has AI interpretation

---

### 3. Valuation Interpretation Enhanced ✅

**Before (Old Report):**
- Line 63: Generic interpretation without fundamental context
- Said "Premium valuation justified by superior fundamentals or growth prospects" (generic)
- No mention of actual ROE, growth rate, or fundamental score

**After (New Report):**
- Line 63: **Enhanced interpretation with fundamental context**
- Now says: "This premium is justified by superior fundamentals (score: 7.4/10), including strong profitability (ROE: 29.6%) and consistent growth (14.9% YoY)"
- Adds: "For quality companies, premium valuations can be sustained if fundamentals remain strong"
- Includes reconciliation: "While PEG ratio of 2.23 suggests overvaluation relative to growth, the premium valuation is supported by exceptional fundamentals: ROE of 29.6% and growth rate of 14.9% demonstrate strong competitive position and execution."

**Status:** ✅ **ENHANCED** - Valuation interpretation now reconciles premium with strong fundamentals
