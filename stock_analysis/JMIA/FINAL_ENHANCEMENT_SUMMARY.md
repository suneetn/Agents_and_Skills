## 🎯 **HOW AGENT GENERATES INTELLIGENCE**

### **When Agent Orchestrates Workflow:**

**Agent Receives SEC Text:**
```
"Jumia's upcountry strategy showed sustained traction, with orders 
outside capital cities accounting for 61% of total orders. This 
momentum reflects both the improving operating environment and the 
quality of our execution, particularly in assortment expansion, 
targeted marketing, and logistics reliability."
```

**Agent Generates Intelligence:**
```python
{
    'strategic_initiatives': [
        "Upcountry strategy showing sustained traction",
        "Assortment expansion in priority categories",
        "Targeted marketing and logistics reliability"
    ],
    'operational_metrics': {
        'geographic_expansion': 61,
        'gmv_growth': 35,
        'orders_growth': 30
    },
    'management_tone': 'bullish',
    'confidence_level': 'high',
    'market_outlook': [
        "Improving operating environment",
        "Resilient consumer demand"
