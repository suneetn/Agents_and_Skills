# SEC Transcript Reality Check
**Date:** 2025-12-30  
**Finding:** Full transcripts rarely filed with SEC

---

## ❌ **REALITY: Full Transcripts Not Typically Filed**

### **Key Finding:**

**Earnings call transcripts are NOT typically filed directly with the SEC.**

According to SEC filing requirements:
- Companies file earnings releases (8-K)
- Companies file financial statements (10-K, 10-Q)
- **Full transcripts are usually NOT included** in SEC filings
- Companies typically provide transcripts on their investor relations websites
- Third-party platforms (Seeking Alpha, etc.) aggregate transcripts

## ✅ **What SEC DOES Provide (That We Can Use):**

### **1. 8-K Earnings Releases**
**What it contains:**
- Earnings announcements
- Key financial metrics
- **Prepared remarks** (sometimes included)
- **Key points from earnings call** (summarized)
- Forward-looking statements

**Use Case:** Extract management commentary and key points

### **2. 10-K/10-Q MD&A Sections**
**What it contains:**
- Management Discussion & Analysis
- Forward-looking statements
- Strategic commentary
- Operational updates
- **Guidance and targets**

**Use Case:** Extract guidance, forward statements, strategic initiatives

### **3. 6-K Filings (Foreign Issuers)**
**What it contains:**
- Earnings releases
- Management commentary
- Forward-looking statements

**Use Case:** Extract guidance for foreign companies like JMIA
