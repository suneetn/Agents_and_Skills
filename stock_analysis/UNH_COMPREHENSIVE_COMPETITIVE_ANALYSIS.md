## Executive Summary

UnitedHealth Group (UNH) is the largest healthcare company in the United States by revenue, operating through two primary segments: UnitedHealthcare (health insurance) and Optum (health services, pharmacy benefits, data analytics).

## Key Takeaways

1. **Industry in Transition:** All five healthcare MCOs down significantly in 2025 due to Medicare utilization, regulatory pressure, and Medicaid redetermination

2. **UNH Remains Leader But Wounded:** DOJ investigation and guidance cuts have severely damaged sentiment; 49% decline may be opportunity for patient long-term investors

3. **HUM Best Technical Setup:** Only stock with clear "Buy" signal; suitable for tactical entry

4. **CI Most Defensive:** PBM diversification provides ballast against insurance volatility

5. **CNC Best Value:** Cheapest on metrics but value trap risk; requires patience

6. **MOH Best Operator:** Highest ROE but overbought; wait for pullback

7. **All Stocks Below 200 SMA:** Long-term downtrends still intact; recovery will take time

8. **Watch These Catalysts:**
   - UNH DOJ investigation resolution
   - Medicare Advantage rate announcements
   - Medicaid redetermination stabilization
   - Q1 2026 earnings for utilization trends
