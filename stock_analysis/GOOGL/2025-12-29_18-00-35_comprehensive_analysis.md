### Technical Interpretation

Strong uptrend with price above key moving averages. Momentum is positive, indicating continued strength. However, consider entry timing to avoid buying at extended levels. RSI at 43.1 is in neutral territory, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions. This suggests the stock is not at extreme levels and has room to move in either direction. For entry timing, this neutral RSI combined with strong fundamentals suggests potential for upward movement. MACD is neutral, indicating lack of clear momentum direction. This suggests consolidation or indecision in the market. Given strong fundamentals (score: 8.6/10), short-term technical weakness may present buying opportunities for long-term investors. Technical indicators are more relevant for entry timing than investment decision for quality companies.

- **Target 3:** $425.34 (35.7% upside) - Optimistic fundamental target (Fundamental (100% of 35.7% earnings growth) - Assumes price appreciation fully reflects earnings growth rate over 12 months)
- **Stop Loss:** $231.84 (below key support at $236.57) - Risk management
- **Trailing Stop:** If position moves favorably, trail stop below key support levels
