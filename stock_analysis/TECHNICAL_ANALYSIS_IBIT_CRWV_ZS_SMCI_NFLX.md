## Trading Recommendations

### Short-Term (1-2 weeks)
1. **SMCI & ZS:** Oversold conditions suggest potential bounce. Consider small positions with tight stops below support levels.
2. **NFLX:** Volume divergence is positive, but wait for break above $97 before considering long positions.
3. **IBIT & CRWV:** Wait for clearer signals. Current setups suggest continued weakness.

### Medium-Term (1-3 months)
- All stocks need to reclaim their respective SMA 20 levels to signal trend reversal
- Monitor for volume confirmation on any rallies
- Watch for breakouts above key resistance levels

### Risk Management
- Set stop losses below key support levels
- Monitor volume on any rallies (need above-average volume for confirmation)
- Be cautious of "dead cat bounces" in oversold stocks

## Conclusion

All five stocks are currently in bearish to neutral technical setups, with most trading below key moving averages. SMCI and ZS show oversold conditions that may present short-term bounce opportunities, but any rallies would face significant resistance. NFLX shows an interesting volume divergence that bears watching. Overall, the technical picture suggests caution, with most stocks needing to reclaim key moving averages before any sustained upward moves.

**Overall Assessment:** Neutral to Bearish across the board, with selective oversold bounce opportunities in SMCI and ZS.
