### Technical Interpretation

Short-term downtrend within longer-term uptrend. Price remains above SMA 200, indicating the primary trend is still intact. The current weakness appears to be a pullback within a larger uptrend, which can present entry opportunities for long-term investors. RSI at 16.6 indicates oversold conditions, suggesting potential for bounce. This may present entry opportunity, especially if fundamentals remain strong. MACD is neutral, indicating lack of clear momentum direction. This suggests consolidation or indecision in the market. With weak fundamentals (score: 1.9/10), technical indicators become more critical. Wait for both technical and fundamental improvement before considering entry.
