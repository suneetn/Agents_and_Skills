- **PEG Ratio:** 0.66 (Undervalued)  
- **Sector Comparison:** Significantly Premium  
- **Valuation Score:** 4.5/10 (Expensive)  

*PEG ratio of 0.66 indicates the stock is undervalued relative to growth. The P/E multiple is justified by strong earnings growth. Trading at 63.3% premium to sector average - Significant premium that requires exceptional performance to justify. Overall valuation score of 4.5/10 indicates expensive valuation. This apparent contradiction can be explained: While PEG suggests growth-adjusted value (undervalued relative to earnings growth), the overall valuation score considers absolute P/E ratios and sector premiums. The PEG undervaluation reflects strong earnings growth expectations, but current absolute valuation levels require continued exceptional performance to justify the premium multiples.*
