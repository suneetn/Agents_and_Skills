## Personal Narrative Guidelines

### Why Personal Narrative Matters

LinkedIn engagement is driven by personal connection. Technical content that reads like a research report gets less engagement than content that tells a personal story. Readers connect with:
- **Your actual experiences** ("I tried X and Y happened")
- **Specific moments** ("Last week when I...")
- **Emotional journey** (frustration → discovery → transformation)
- **Real results** (your outcomes, not just others' examples)

### Personal Narrative Principles

**1. Lead with Personal Experience**
- ❌ "I've been watching the AI agent space closely..."
- ✅ "I spent last month frustrated with AI coding tools. They'd suggest code, I'd review it, fix errors. I was still doing 80% of the work."

**2. Use Specific Moments**
- ❌ "Real examples from developers show..."
- ✅ "Last week, I asked Goose to build a React dashboard. Two minutes later, it was running. No review. No fixes. Just done."

**3. Show Your Journey**
- Include frustration/pain points you experienced
- Describe the moment of discovery
- Share the transformation/outcome
- Connect to broader insights

**4. Make It About You, Not Just the Tool**
- ❌ "Goose operates autonomously. Give it a task, and it..."
- ✅ "Here's what I built last week: I needed a quick prototype for a client demo. Instead of spending hours, I told Goose..."

**5. Use First-Person Throughout**
- "I tried..."
- "I discovered..."
- "I built..."
- "I learned..."
- "My experience..."

### Personal Narrative Checklist

Before publishing, ensure:
- [ ] Hook includes personal discovery moment
- [ ] Introduction establishes your personal stake/context
- [ ] Use cases include "I did X and Y happened" moments
- [ ] Metrics are YOUR results, not just others' examples
- [ ] Lessons learned are from YOUR experience
- [ ] Emotional beats present (frustration → discovery → transformation)
- [ ] Specific moments referenced ("Last week...", "Yesterday...", "When I...")

### Balancing Personal and Technical

**Good Balance:**
- Personal story frames the technical content
- Technical details support the personal narrative
- Metrics validate personal experience
- Insights emerge from personal journey

**Too Personal (Avoid):**
- Only personal anecdotes, no technical depth
- No metrics or validation
- Pure opinion without evidence

**Too Technical (Avoid):**
- Research report style
- No personal connection
- Generic "developers" instead of "I"
- Third-person throughout

## Technical Writing Guidelines

### Do
- ✅ Include specific metrics and numbers
- ✅ Explain technical concepts accessibly
- ✅ Show before/after comparisons
- ✅ Discuss trade-offs and considerations
- ✅ Share code snippets or architecture when relevant
- ✅ Reference specific tools and technologies
- ✅ Include cost/performance metrics
- ✅ **Use personal narrative to frame technical content**
- ✅ **Include "I tried X and Y happened" moments**
- ✅ **Share your actual results and experiences**

### Don't
- ❌ Use jargon without explanation
- ❌ Make claims without proof/metrics
- ❌ Oversimplify complex technical topics
- ❌ Forget to mention limitations
- ❌ Write code-heavy content without context
- ❌ Compare tools without clear criteria
- ❌ **Write in third-person research report style**
- ❌ **Use generic "developers" instead of "I"**
- ❌ **Skip personal experience and jump straight to facts**

## Formatting for Tech Content

### Code References
- Use inline code: `functionName()` for simple references
- Use code blocks for examples (but keep them short)
- Explain what code does, don't just show it

### Metrics Formatting
- **Bold numbers**: "**90%** reduction"
- **Before/After**: "10-15 minutes → seconds"
- **Cost**: "$0.01 per query"
- **Scale**: "1,000 active users"

### Technical Terms
- Define acronyms on first use: "RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)"
- Link to resources when helpful
- Use analogies for complex concepts

## Content Ideas for Tech Leaders

1. **Use Case Series**
   - Document intelligence with RAG
   - Natural language query systems
   - Context-aware applications
   - Cost optimization strategies

2. **Technical Deep Dives**
   - "Building RAG: What I Learned"
   - "Prompt Engineering: 80% of the Work"
   - "Cost Optimization: GPT-4 vs GPT-4o-mini"

3. **Tool Comparisons**
   - "RAG vs Fine-tuning: My Experience"
   - "Vector Databases Compared"
   - "LLM APIs: Which One When?"

4. **Lessons Learned**
   - "5 Mistakes I Made Building AI Systems"
   - "What I Wish I Knew About [Technology]"
   - "The One Thing That Changed Everything"

## Engagement Strategies for Tech Content

### Questions That Drive Comments
- "What AI use cases have you found most valuable?"
- "Which approach worked better for you: [A] or [B]?"
- "What tools would you add to this list?"
- "Have you tried [similar approach]? How did it go?"

### Invitations
- "I'd love to hear your experiences with [technology]"
- "Share your own use cases in the comments"
- "What would you add to this list?"

## Output Location

## Workflow

When creating a tech LinkedIn article:

1. **Choose your framework** (Use Case, Deep Dive, or Comparison)
2. **Select appropriate template**
3. **Write your tech hook** (bold statement + personal discovery moment)
4. **Establish personal context** (your frustration, discovery, stake)
5. **Structure your content** using the template
6. **Include YOUR specific experiences** ("I tried X and Y happened")
7. **Include YOUR metrics** (your results, not just others' examples)
8. **Format for LinkedIn** (short paragraphs, line breaks, bold)
9. **Add technical insights** from YOUR experience in lessons learned
10. **End with engagement hook** (question for tech community)
11. **Review personal narrative checklist** before posting
12. **Engage with comments** after posting
