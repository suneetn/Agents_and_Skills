# Writing Content in Personal Voice

Create content that matches the user's personal writing voice, combining structured brevity, research-informed insights, and actionable frameworks. This voice is inspired by successful influencers (Allie K. Miller, Dharmesh Shah) while maintaining authentic expertise and research-backed perspectives.

## Core Approach

When creating content in this voice:

1. **Apply voice principles** - Structured brevity, authentic expertise, actionable frameworks, contrarian clarity, research-informed insights
2. **Match content structure** - Use appropriate format (LinkedIn post, medium post, long-form) with correct length guidelines
3. **Use language patterns** - Apply opening hooks, framework introductions, and closing patterns that match the voice
4. **Ensure formatting** - Follow formatting guidelines for the content type
5. **Validate against guidelines** - Check against do's and don'ts before finalizing

See `./reference/voice-principles.md` for detailed voice characteristics and `./reference/content-structures.md` for format-specific patterns.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Understand the Request

- What type of content? (LinkedIn post, article, framework)
- What's the topic or subject?
- What's the goal? (Educate, engage, convert, share insight)
- Any specific requirements or constraints?

### 2. Choose the Format

**LinkedIn Post (50-150 words):**
- Ultra-concise, minimal formatting
- Single insight or framework preview
- See `./reference/linkedin-post-patterns.md`

**Medium Post (300-800 words):**
- Structured framework with numbered steps
- Problem → Research → Framework → Implementation
- See `./reference/medium-post-patterns.md`

**Long-Form (1000-2000 words):**
- Comprehensive guide with executive summary
- Research methodology, findings, framework, implementation
- See `./reference/long-form-patterns.md`

### 3. Apply Voice Principles

**Structured Brevity:**
- Every word earns its place
- No fluff, maximum impact
- Scannable format

**Authentic Expertise:**
- Share real experiences (if user provides context)
- Admit limitations when appropriate
- Show research methodology when relevant
- No corporate speak

**Actionable Frameworks:**
- Provide structured tools readers can use immediately
- Numbered steps (3-7 steps ideal)
- Real-world examples

**Contrarian Clarity:**
- Challenge assumptions when backed by research
- Back claims with evidence
- Make complex simple
- Connect to business outcomes

**Research-Informed Insights:**
- Data-driven perspectives
- Show thinking process
- Practical application

See `./reference/voice-principles.md` for complete details.

### 4. Use Language Patterns

**Opening Hooks:**
- "Here's what I've learned about [topic]..."
- "After researching [X], I found..."
- "The problem with [common approach] is..."
- "Most people think [X], but here's what actually works..."

**Framework Introductions:**
- "Here's a [X]-step framework I've developed..."
- "After analyzing [research], here's the structure that works..."
- "Based on my research, here's how to approach this..."

**Closing Patterns:**
- "What's your experience with [topic]?"
- "Which step resonates most with you?"
- "Here's what to try next..."
- "The key takeaway: [summary]"

See `./reference/language-patterns.md` for complete list.

### 5. Format Appropriately

**LinkedIn Posts:**
- Minimal formatting (plain text preferred)
- Short paragraphs (1-2 sentences max)
- Line breaks for readability
- No excessive emojis
- Scannable format

**Medium Posts:**
- Clear headings
- Numbered lists for frameworks
- Bullet points for takeaways
- Bold for key concepts (sparingly)
- White space for readability

**Long-Form:**
- Executive summary upfront
- Clear sections with visual hierarchy
- Research citations when applicable
- Actionable takeaways highlighted

### 6. Validate Against Guidelines

**Do's:**
- ✅ Keep LinkedIn posts concise (50-150 words)
- ✅ Provide frameworks readers can use immediately
- ✅ Share research methodology when relevant
- ✅ Be honest about limitations and trade-offs
- ✅ Use structured approaches (numbered steps)
- ✅ Connect everything to business outcomes
- ✅ Challenge assumptions when backed by research
- ✅ Show your work and thinking process
- ✅ Make complex topics accessible

**Don'ts:**
- ❌ Over-explain or add unnecessary words
- ❌ Use jargon without explanation
- ❌ Pretend to know everything
- ❌ Create frameworks without practical application
- ❌ Ignore research or data when available
- ❌ Use corporate speak or marketing fluff
- ❌ Skip the "why" behind recommendations
- ❌ Make claims without evidence
- ❌ Over-format posts

See `./reference/guidelines-checklist.md` for complete list.

## Examples

### Example 1: LinkedIn Post (Ultra-Short)

**User Query**: "Write a LinkedIn post about focusing on one AI use case"

**Approach**:
1. Use contrarian hook
2. Include research-backed insight
3. Provide actionable advice
4. Keep under 100 words
5. End with engagement question

**Output**:
> Most teams are asking AI to do too much. Here's what I've learned after researching 50+ AI implementations:
> 
> Focus on one use case. Nail it. Then expand.
> 
> The teams that succeed start with a single, well-defined problem. They solve it completely before moving to the next.
> 
> The teams that struggle try to solve everything at once.
> 
> Pick one thing. Do it well. Then iterate.
> 
> What's the one AI use case you're focusing on?

### Example 2: Framework Post (Medium)

**User Query**: "Create a framework for evaluating AI tools"

**Approach**:
1. Start with problem statement
2. Introduce framework with research context
3. Provide 3-5 clear steps
4. Include implementation guidance
5. End with key takeaway

**Output**: See `./templates/framework-post-example.md` for complete example.

### Example 3: Contrarian Post (Short)

**User Query**: "Write a contrarian post about AI hype"

**Approach**:
1. Challenge common assumption
2. Back with research finding
3. Provide honest perspective
4. Memorable takeaway
5. Engagement question

**Output**:
> Everyone's talking about AI transforming everything. But here's what my research shows:
> 
> Most AI "transformations" are actually incremental improvements. And that's OK.
> 
> After analyzing successful AI implementations, I found that the biggest wins come from solving small, specific problems really well. Not from trying to revolutionize entire workflows.
> 
> The hype says "AI will change everything."
> 
> The reality: AI solves specific problems better than before.
> 
> Focus on the problems, not the hype.
> 
> What specific problem are you solving?
