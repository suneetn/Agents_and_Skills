# Content Ideation

Generate creative content ideas, brainstorm topics, explore angles, and develop hooks for posts, articles, frameworks, and other content formats.

## Core Approach

When ideating content:

1. **Understand context** - What's the goal, audience, format, and constraints?
2. **Generate diverse ideas** - Multiple angles, hooks, and approaches
3. **Evaluate ideas** - Assess potential, uniqueness, and fit
4. **Refine and prioritize** - Select best ideas and develop them further

See `./reference/ideation-methods.md` for detailed brainstorming techniques and `./reference/evaluation-criteria.md` for assessing idea quality.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Understand the Request

- What type of content? (LinkedIn post, article, framework, etc.)
- What's the goal? (Educate, engage, convert, share insight)
- Who's the audience? (Tech professionals, entrepreneurs, general business)
- Any constraints? (Topic area, length, format requirements)
- Any inspiration or starting point? (Trend, question, observation)

### 2. Generate Ideas

**Brainstorming Techniques:**

**Free Association:**
- Start with a core topic or question
- Generate related ideas without filtering
- Build on each idea to create variations
- See `./reference/ideation-methods.md` for complete list

**Angle Exploration:**
- Contrarian angle - Challenge common assumptions
- Research angle - Data-driven insights
- Personal angle - Experience-based stories
- Framework angle - Structured approaches
- Problem-solution angle - Address pain points

**Hook Development:**
- Surprising statistic or finding
- Contrarian statement
- Problem statement
- Question that makes readers think
- Personal revelation or learning

**Format-Specific Ideas:**

**LinkedIn Posts (50-150 words):**
- Single insight or framework preview
- Contrarian perspective
- Research finding
- Quick tip or lesson learned

**Articles (300-800 words):**
- Comprehensive framework
- Problem-solution deep dive
- Research analysis
- Step-by-step guide

**Long-Form (1000+ words):**
- Comprehensive guide
- Multi-framework exploration
- Research report
- Detailed methodology

### 3. Evaluate Ideas

**Evaluation Criteria:**

**Potential:**
- Does it solve a real problem?
- Will it resonate with the audience?
- Is there demand for this content?

**Uniqueness:**
- Is this a fresh angle?
- What makes it different?
- Does it add new value?

**Feasibility:**
- Can you execute this well?
- Do you have the expertise?
- Is research available?

**Fit:**
- Matches your voice and style?
- Aligns with your goals?
- Appropriate for the format?

See `./reference/evaluation-criteria.md` for detailed evaluation framework.

### 4. Refine and Prioritize

**Refinement Process:**

1. **Expand promising ideas** - Add details, angles, hooks
2. **Combine related ideas** - Merge complementary concepts
3. **Develop hooks** - Create compelling opening lines
4. **Identify research needs** - What information is needed?
5. **Outline structure** - Basic framework or flow

**Prioritization:**

- Rank by potential impact
- Consider execution difficulty
- Balance variety (don't cluster similar ideas)
- Select top 3-5 ideas for development

### 5. Present Ideas

**Format for Presentation:**

**For Each Idea:**
- **Title/Hook** - Compelling opening or title
- **Angle** - What makes this unique
- **Key Points** - Main insights or framework steps
- **Research Needs** - What information is needed
- **Format Recommendation** - Best format (post, article, etc.)
- **Potential Impact** - Why this matters

**Group Ideas:**
- By format (LinkedIn posts, articles, frameworks)
- By theme (AI, productivity, leadership, etc.)
- By urgency (quick wins vs. deep dives)

## Examples

### Example 1: LinkedIn Post Ideation

**User Query**: "I need ideas for LinkedIn posts about AI implementation"

**Approach**:
1. Understand: LinkedIn posts, AI implementation focus
2. Generate: Multiple angles (contrarian, research, framework, problem-solution)
3. Evaluate: Potential, uniqueness, fit
4. Refine: Develop hooks and key points
5. Present: Top 5 ideas with hooks

**Output**:
1. **Hook**: "Most teams are asking AI to do too much..."
   - **Angle**: Contrarian - focus on one use case
   - **Key Point**: Start narrow, expand later
   - **Format**: LinkedIn post (80-100 words)

2. **Hook**: "After researching 50+ AI implementations..."
   - **Angle**: Research-backed insight
   - **Key Point**: Simple solutions win
   - **Format**: LinkedIn post (100-120 words)

3. **Hook**: "Here's a 3-step framework for evaluating AI tools..."
   - **Angle**: Framework approach
   - **Key Points**: Problem clarity, solution fit, impact measurability
   - **Format**: LinkedIn post (120-150 words) or medium article

### Example 2: Article Ideation

**User Query**: "Generate ideas for articles about document intelligence"

**Approach**:
1. Understand: Articles (300-800 words), document intelligence focus
2. Generate: Framework, problem-solution, implementation guide angles
3. Evaluate: Depth potential, research availability, audience value
4. Refine: Develop structure and key sections
5. Present: Top 3 article concepts

**Output**:
1. **Title**: "The 4-Step Framework for Implementing Document Intelligence"
   - **Structure**: Problem → Research → Framework → Implementation
   - **Key Sections**: Use case definition, approach selection, impact measurement, iteration
   - **Format**: Medium article (400-600 words)

2. **Title**: "Why Most Document Search Solutions Fail (And What Actually Works)"
   - **Structure**: Problem identification → Common failures → Working solutions
   - **Key Sections**: Search vs. organization, simplicity over complexity, real metrics
   - **Format**: Medium article (500-700 words)

### Example 3: Framework Ideation

**User Query**: "I want to create a framework for evaluating AI tools"

**Approach**:
1. Understand: Framework format, AI tool evaluation focus
2. Generate: Evaluation criteria, decision factors, assessment methods
3. Evaluate: Completeness, actionability, memorability
4. Refine: Structure into clear steps with criteria
