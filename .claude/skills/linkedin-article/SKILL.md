# LinkedIn Article Creation Skill

Create compelling LinkedIn content that drives engagement, builds your professional brand, and connects with your audience.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when creating:
- Long-form LinkedIn articles (1000-2000 words)
- Short LinkedIn posts (150-300 words)
- Thought leadership content
- Professional insights and lessons learned
- Case studies and use cases
- Industry commentary

## Core Frameworks

### 1. Problem-Agitate-Solution (PAS)

**Structure:**
1. **Problem**: State a relatable problem your audience faces
2. **Agitate**: Deepen the pain point (what happens if unsolved?)
3. **Solution**: Present your approach/method
4. **Proof**: Show results/impact
5. **Call to Action**: Engage readers

**Example Pattern:**
```
Problem: "I work with dozens of documents every week..."
Agitate: "Finding information meant scrolling through PDFs, asking colleagues..."
Solution: "I built a document intelligence system using RAG..."
Proof: "Questions that took 10-15 minutes now take seconds..."
CTA: "What AI use cases have you found valuable?"
```

### 2. Story-Insight-Action (SIA)

**Structure:**
1. **Story**: Personal anecdote or case study
2. **Insight**: What you learned or discovered
3. **Action**: What readers can do differently

**Example Pattern:**
```
Story: "Last month, I spent 2 hours searching through documents..."
Insight: "I realized that semantic search beats keyword matching..."
Action: "Here's how you can implement this..."
```

### 3. Hook-Value-Engage (HVE)

**Structure:**
1. **Hook**: Compelling opening line (question, bold statement, or surprising fact)
2. **Value**: Deliver actionable insights
3. **Engage**: End with question or call to action

**Example Hooks:**
- Bold statement: "Most AI demos are useless. Here's what actually works."
- Question: "What if you could query your entire document library in plain English?"
- Surprising fact: "I reduced document search time by 90% using a $0.01 per query solution."

## Writing Style Patterns

### Successful Creator Styles

**1. Thought Leadership (Reid Hoffman Style)**
- Long-form essays (1000+ words)
- Deep analysis and forward-thinking

**2. Relatable Expert (Naomi Simson Style)**
- Conversational tone

- **Best for**: How-to content, lessons learned

**3. Engaging Humor (Corporate Natalie Style)**
- Light humor and satire
- Relatable scenarios

**4. Tech Leader Style**
- Problem → Solution → Impact structure
- Technical but accessible

- **Best for**: Technical content, case studies

## LinkedIn-Specific Formatting Rules

### Paragraph Structure
- **Maximum 2-3 sentences per paragraph**
- **Use line breaks liberally** (every 2-3 paragraphs)
- **Short paragraphs = better engagement**

### Visual Elements
- **Bold key phrases** (LinkedIn algorithm favors this)
- **Bullet points** for lists (easier to scan)
- **Numbers** for steps or metrics
- **Emojis sparingly** (1-2 per post max, if at all)

### Optimal Length
- **Posts**: 150-300 words (highest engagement)
- **Articles**: 1000-2000 words (deeper engagement)
- **Sweet spot**: 1200-1500 words for articles
