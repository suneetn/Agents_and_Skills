## What is BMAD?

**BMAD** stands for **Breakthrough Method for Agile AI-Driven Development** (also referred to as **Breakthrough Method for Agentic Development**). It is a framework that integrates AI agents into the software development lifecycle with a strong emphasis on specification-driven development.

### Core Concept

BMAD places detailed specifications at the center of the development process, using AI agents to create, manage, and implement these specifications throughout the software development lifecycle. This approach ensures that all stakeholders—both human and AI—have a shared understanding of project requirements and objectives.

## Key Features of BMAD Method

### 1. Agentic Planning

BMAD employs specialized AI agents that collaborate to generate comprehensive planning documents:

- **Analyst Agent:** Analyzes requirements and business needs
- **Project Manager Agent:** Coordinates planning and resource allocation
- **Architect Agent:** Designs technical architecture and system structure

**Outputs:**
- Comprehensive Product Requirement Documents (PRDs)
- Technical architecture diagrams
- User experience (UX) specifications and guidelines
- Detailed planning documents that serve as the foundation for development

**Benefits:**
- Ensures all development activities are grounded in well-defined specifications
- Reduces ambiguity and miscommunication
- Aligns technical implementation with business objectives

---

### 2. Context-Engineered Development

Following the planning phase, BMAD maintains context throughout development:

- **Scrum Master Agent:** Transforms detailed plans into granular development stories
- **Story Files:** Include architectural context, implementation guidelines, and testing criteria
- **Context Preservation:** Ensures developers have clear, context-rich directives

**Key Aspects:**
- Detailed story files that embed full context
- Implementation guidelines derived from specifications
- Testing criteria integrated into development stories
- Seamless transition from specification to implementation

**Benefits:**
- Minimizes context loss between planning and execution

### 3. Parallel AI Development

BMAD enables concurrent development through structured decomposition:

- **Feature Decomposition:** Complex features broken into isolated work streams
- **Parallel Implementation:** Multiple AI agents work simultaneously on different components
- **Integration Management:** Shared contracts and bounded contexts maintain integration
- **Isolated Work Streams:** Each agent works independently while maintaining system coherence

**Benefits:**
- Accelerates development timelines
