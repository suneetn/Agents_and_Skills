## Executive Summary

Axon Enterprise is the dominant player in public safety technology, with near-monopolistic market positions in body-worn cameras (85% share) and TASERs (95% share). The company has successfully transitioned from a hardware-focused weapons manufacturer to an AI-powered SaaS platform ecosystem. With 33%+ revenue growth, 114% earnings growth, and strong analyst consensus (Strong Buy, $814 target), AXON represents a compelling growth story—albeit at a premium valuation (P/E 177, PEG 1.07).

**Investment Thesis:** AXON is a best-in-class compounder riding secular tailwinds in law enforcement technology, AI adoption, and digital evidence management. The recent 30% pullback from highs presents an opportunity for long-term investors.
