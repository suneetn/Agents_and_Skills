## Executive Summary

Micron Technology is at the center of the AI infrastructure revolution. As one of only three major memory manufacturers globally (alongside Samsung and SK Hynix), Micron has emerged as a **critical enabler of AI compute** through its leadership in High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) and data center DRAM.

**Investment Thesis:** Micron is transitioning from a cyclical commodity memory company to a **strategic AI infrastructure supplier**. The company's FY2025 performance was extraordinary: **$37.38 billion in revenue (+48.9% YoY)** and a stunning turnaround from a **$5.83B loss to $8.54B profit**. 

**Key Catalyst:** Micron has taken the HBM technology lead with **HBM4 memory delivering 2.8TB/s bandwidth**, ahead of Samsung and SK Hynix. This positions Micron as a preferred supplier for NVIDIA and other AI chip makers.

**Current Technical Positioning:** The stock has surged **173% over the past year** and is trading at new 52-week highs near $315. While the primary trend is strongly bullish, RSI at 69.62 suggests the stock is approaching overbought territory. A pullback could present a better entry point.

## The Investment Case

### 1. AI Memory Supercycle

We are in the early innings of an **AI memory supercycle**. Every AI training run, every inference query, every LLM prompt requires massive amounts of high-speed memory. Key dynamics:

- **AI training** requires HBM for bandwidth-intensive tensor operations
- **AI inference** is scaling rapidly as GenAI goes mainstream
- **Data center DRAM** demand growing 20%+ annually through 2028
- **HBM demand** expected to grow 5x by 2028

**Micron's positioning:** As one of only three HBM manufacturers globally, Micron captures significant pricing power and margin expansion as demand outstrips supply.

### 2. HBM Technology Leadership

In October 2025, Micron shipped **HBM4 samples with 2.8TB/s bandwidth**, the fastest HBM ever made. This positions Micron ahead of Samsung and SK Hynix:

| Company | HBM Generation | Bandwidth | Status |
|---------|----------------|-----------|--------|
| **Micron** | HBM4 | 2.8TB/s | Sampling |
| Samsung | HBM3E | 1.2TB/s | Production |
| SK Hynix | HBM3E | 1.2TB/s | Production |

**Why it matters:** NVIDIA's next-generation Blackwell GPUs will use HBM3E/HBM4. Being first to market with HBM4 positions Micron as a strategic supplier.

### 3. Strategic Pivot to Enterprise

In December 2025, Micron announced it would **discontinue its Crucial consumer brand** by February 2026. This signals:

- Focus on **high-margin enterprise products** (HBM, data center)
- Exit from **low-margin consumer memory**
- Capital allocation toward **AI infrastructure**
- Margin expansion as product mix shifts

### 4. Massive Capacity Expansion

Micron is investing aggressively in HBM capacity:

| Investment | Location | Amount | Timeline |
|------------|----------|--------|----------|
| **HBM Fab** | Hiroshima, Japan | $9.6B | 2028 production |
| **US Fabs** | Idaho, Virginia | $15B+ | CHIPS Act supported |
| **Singapore** | Expansion | $5B+ | Ongoing |

**Why it matters:** Memory is supply-constrained. Micron's capacity expansion will capture incremental AI demand.

### 5. Cyclical Trough Behind Us

Memory is notoriously cyclical. The key insight: **the trough is behind us**.

- FY2024 was brutal: $5.83B net loss
- FY2025 turnaround: $8.54B net income (+$14.4B swing)
- Pricing power returning as AI demand outpaces supply
- Inventory correction complete

## Risk Assessment

### Key Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Memory cycle downturn | Medium | High | AI demand more durable |
| Samsung/SK Hynix catch-up | Medium | Medium | Continued R&D investment |
| China ban escalation | Medium | Medium | Diversified manufacturing |
| NVIDIA supplier concentration | Low | Medium | AMD, other customers |
| Execution on HBM ramp | Medium | High | Proven manufacturing track record |

### Risk Factors to Monitor

1. **NVIDIA HBM supplier announcements**
2. **Memory pricing trends** (DRAM spot prices)
3. **China policy developments**
4. **Samsung/SK Hynix HBM roadmaps**
5. **Data center capex trends** (hyperscaler spending)

## Valuation Perspective

### Current Valuation

| Metric | MU | Semiconductor Avg |
|--------|-----|-------------------|
| P/E | 29.9x | 25-35x |
| P/S | 3.6x | 5-8x |
| EV/EBITDA | 7.7x | 12-18x |
| P/B | 2.5x | 3-5x |

### Valuation Summary

Micron trades at a **discount to semiconductor peers** despite:
- Technology leadership in HBM
- Massive earnings turnaround
- Structural AI tailwinds

The discount reflects memory's historical cyclicality. If Micron proves the AI memory cycle is more durable, multiple expansion is likely.

### Price Targets

| Source | Target | Upside/Downside |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Analyst Consensus | $282 | -11% (below current) |
| 52-Week High | $316 | At current level |
| Bull Case (40x P/E) | $420 | +33% |
| Bear Case (20x P/E) | $210 | -33% |

**Note:** Stock has run past analyst targets. Analysts likely to revise upward.

## Investment Recommendation

### Recommendation: **BUY ON PULLBACK**

**Rationale:**

1. **Structural Tailwind:** AI memory demand is a multi-year growth driver
2. **Technology Leadership:** HBM4 positions Micron ahead of competitors
3. **Turnaround Confirmed:** $8.54B profit vs. $5.83B loss is transformational
4. **Reasonable Valuation:** P/E of 30x is fair for 50%+ revenue growth
5. **Tactical Concern:** Stock extended near overbought, wait for pullback

### Position Sizing Considerations

- **Conservative:** 2-4% of portfolio
- **Moderate:** 4-6% of portfolio
- **Aggressive:** 6-8% of portfolio

### Entry Strategy

1. **Aggressive Entry:** Current levels ($315) for long-term holders
2. **Preferred Entry:** Pullback to $260-280 range (near SMA 20/50)
3. **Conservative Entry:** Wait for RSI to cool below 50

### Price Targets
