## Risk Assessment

### Valuation Concerns

| Metric | Current State | Risk Level |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| NVDA P/E | ~65 | High but justified by growth |
| AI sector P/S | 10-20x | Elevated |
| Semiconductor P/E | ~30 average | Reasonable |

### Key Risks to Monitor

1. **AI Hype Cycle Correction:** High valuations leave room for pullbacks
2. **Competition:** AMD, Intel, custom chips from Google/Amazon challenging NVDA
3. **Regulatory Risk:** Government AI regulations could slow adoption
4. **Energy Constraints:** Data center power demand may outpace supply
5. **Concentration Risk:** Heavy weighting to NVDA in many AI funds

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

- **Dollar-cost average** into positions rather than lump sum
- **Maintain diversification** across the AI value chain
- **Include defensive plays** like utilities and infrastructure
- **Set position limits** (no single stock >10-15% of portfolio)
- **Rebalance quarterly** to lock in gains
