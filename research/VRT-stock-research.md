## Recommendations

**Rationale:**
Vertiv presents a compelling investment opportunity driven by AI infrastructure demand, but premium valuation requires careful consideration. The company's strong financial performance, strategic positioning, and $9.5B backlog support a positive outlook. However, the premium valuation (2.66x sector average P/E) and operational challenges in EMEA create risk.

- Monitor for fundamental improvements (EMEA operations, margin expansion)

**Position Sizing:**
- Moderate position size given premium valuation
- Consider as part of diversified AI infrastructure portfolio
- Monitor quarterly results for execution on guidance

### Exit Strategy

**Price Targets:**
- **Near-term Target:** $188-199 (analyst consensus to technical resistance)
- **Long-term Target:** Dependent on execution of margin expansion (25% by 2029)

**Stop Loss:**
- Consider stop loss below key support ($119-121 range)
- Monitor for fundamental deterioration (guidance misses, margin compression)

### Monitoring Points

**Key Metrics to Watch:**
1. Quarterly revenue growth (target: 20%+ organic)
2. Operating margin expansion (target: 25% by 2029)
3. EMEA operational improvements
4. Backlog conversion to revenue
5. Acquisition integration success

**Risk Signals:**
- Guidance reductions
- Margin compression
- Backlog decline
