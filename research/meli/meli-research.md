## Investment Recommendations

### Based on Research Findings

**Overall Recommendation: HOLD with Accumulation on Weakness**

**Rationale:**
1. **Fundamental Strength:** Exceptional growth metrics (30-37% revenue growth, 93.6% net income growth) justify premium valuation
2. **Technical Weakness:** Current downtrend suggests waiting for better entry point or trend reversal confirmation
3. **Analyst Optimism:** Strong Buy consensus with 48% upside potential suggests long-term opportunity
4. **Valuation Balance:** Premium multiples are justified by growth, but create risk if growth slows

### Entry Strategy

**For New Positions:**
- **Conservative:** Wait for break above $2,020 with volume confirmation
- **Moderate:** Consider scaling in near $1,900-$1,950 support levels
- **Aggressive:** Current levels ($1,975) acceptable for long-term investors willing to accept near-term volatility

**For Existing Positions:**
- **Hold** if position size is appropriate and time horizon is long-term (3-5 years)
- **Consider trimming** if position is oversized and risk tolerance is low
- **Add on weakness** if conviction is high and looking to average down

### Exit Strategy

**Profit Targets:**
- **Near-term:** $2,117 (7% gain) - Take partial profits
- **Medium-term:** $2,260-$2,800 (14-42% gain) - Take additional profits
- **Long-term:** $2,645+ (34%+ gain) - Consider full exit or significant trim

**Stop Loss Levels:**
- **Tight Stop:** $1,900 (3.8% loss) - For short-term traders
- **Moderate Stop:** $1,850 (6.3% loss) - For swing traders
- **Wide Stop:** $1,724 (12.7% loss) - For long-term investors

### Risk Management

1. **Position Sizing:** Limit position size to manage valuation risk
2. **Dollar-Cost Averaging:** Consider averaging in over time rather than single large purchase
3. **Stop Losses:** Use stop losses to limit downside risk
4. **Diversification:** Ensure MELI is part of a diversified portfolio
5. **Time Horizon:** Align investment horizon with growth company characteristics (3-5 years minimum)
