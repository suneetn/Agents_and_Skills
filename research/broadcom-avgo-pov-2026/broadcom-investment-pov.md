## Executive Summary

Broadcom has transformed from a traditional semiconductor company into an AI infrastructure powerhouse. The company's stock is up 116% year-over-year, driven by explosive demand for custom AI accelerators and networking solutions. With a newly revealed $10B+ partnership with OpenAI and an AI backlog of $73B through FY2027, Broadcom is positioned as the essential "picks and shovels" player in the AI revolution.

**Investment Rating:** HOLD at current levels, BUY on dips to $320-330

**Key Thesis:** Broadcom owns the custom silicon and networking fabric that powers AI inference at scale. While NVIDIA dominates training GPUs, Broadcom captures the inference market where hyperscalers need custom chips optimized for their specific workloads.

## AI Strategy Deep Dive

### The Custom Accelerator Thesis

Broadcom's AI strategy centers on a fundamental insight: hyperscalers with frontier AI models need custom silicon, not general-purpose GPUs.

**Why Custom Chips Matter:**
1. Training AI models requires massive compute but happens episodically
2. Inference (serving predictions to users) happens continuously at enormous scale
3. Custom inference chips deliver 3-5x better performance per watt vs general GPUs
4. At ChatGPT scale, efficiency gains save tens of billions in annual operating costs

### XPU Customer Base

Broadcom serves an elite group of hyperscalers developing frontier AI models:

| Customer | Product | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Google | TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) | Long-standing, 3M+ units/year |
| Meta | Custom AI accelerator | Active |
| ByteDance | Custom AI accelerator | Active |
| OpenAI | Custom inference chip | NEW - $10B+ order |
| Microsoft | Unknown (speculated) | Potential 5th customer |

### The OpenAI Partnership

The most significant recent development is OpenAI's decision to work with Broadcom for custom AI chips:

- **Order Size:** $10B+ for AI racks based on Broadcom's XPU technology
- **Strategic Rationale:** Reduce dependence on NVIDIA, optimize for ChatGPT inference workloads
- **Timeline:** Manufacturing capacity secured with TSMC, first chips expected 2026
- **Implications:** Validates custom silicon thesis; could expand significantly

### AI Networking Dominance

Beyond custom chips, Broadcom dominates AI networking infrastructure:

- **Market Share:** Industry-leading in Ethernet AI switches
- **Key Product:** Tomahawk 6 (launched 2025, highest bandwidth switch)
- **TAM Expansion:** AI data centers require 10x more networking bandwidth
- **FY2026 Estimate:** ~$13B in AI networking revenue (per HSBC)

## Growth Catalysts

### Near-Term (2026)

1. **OpenAI Ramp:** First custom chips enter production
2. **Tomahawk 6 Adoption:** Next-gen switch deployment
3. **VMware Synergies:** Full integration benefits realized
4. **Fifth Customer:** Potential Microsoft announcement
5. **AI Backlog:** $73B through FY2027 provides visibility

### Medium-Term (2027-2028)

1. **Custom Silicon TAM:** Projected to reach $85B by 2027
2. **Inference Dominance:** As AI models deploy at scale
3. **Software Recurring Revenue:** VMware subscription transition
4. **New Hyperscaler Customers:** Additional frontier model developers
