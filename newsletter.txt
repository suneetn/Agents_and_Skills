MARKET SUMMARY
------------------------------
Markets continue their upward trajectory into 2026, driven by AI infrastructure buildout and strong corporate earnings. The semiconductor sector (SMH +49% in 2025) leads the charge, with chip equipment makers and memory suppliers benefiting from insatiable datacenter demand. Barclays analysts note 'AI is still the place to be' and expect a 'choppy but cheerful year for chips.' Key risks include stretched valuations in AI names and potential Fed rate path uncertainty.
