## Content Strategy Best Practices

### 1. Start with the Problem
- **Identify real pain points** your audience faces
- **Challenge common assumptions** when appropriate
- **Connect to business outcomes** immediately
- **Make it relatable** to your target audience

**Example Approach:**
- ❌ "AI is transforming business..."
- ✅ "Your team is creating too many individual prompts, and it's causing inconsistency..."

### 2. Provide Frameworks, Not Just Ideas
- **Structure your solutions** with clear steps
- **Create reusable methodologies** readers can adapt
- **Use numbered lists** for sequential processes
- **Break complex concepts** into manageable components

**Example Approach:**
- ❌ "Use AI better in your workflow"
- ✅ "Here's a 5-step routine to boost your AI output: 1) Feed context, 2) Demand volume..."

### 3. Emphasize Standardization
- **Advocate for protocols** and shared standards
- **Highlight consistency** as a key success factor
- **Focus on organizational alignment** over individual creativity
- **Promote collaboration** and shared understanding

**Example Approach:**
- ❌ "Everyone should create their own prompts"
- ✅ "Your team needs a one-prompt standard to ensure consistency..."

### 4. Balance Technical Accuracy with Accessibility
- **Explain technical concepts** in business-friendly language
- **Use jargon sparingly** and always define it
- **Connect to business outcomes** not just technical features
- **Make content accessible** to non-technical audiences

**Example Approach:**
- ❌ "Leverage transformer architectures for NLP tasks..."
- ✅ "Use AI to process and understand your business documents more effectively..."

## Writing Structure Best Practices

### Opening Hooks
1. **Contrarian statements** that challenge assumptions
2. **Direct problem statements** that resonate
3. **Personal experience** that builds credibility
4. **Bold claims** backed by evidence

**Effective Hook Patterns:**
- "Your team doesn't need [common approach]..."
- "The problem with [popular method] is..."
- "I've been perfecting this [methodology]..."
- "Why [common belief] isn't enough..."

### Body Structure
1. **Problem identification** - What's wrong or missing
2. **Why it matters** - Business impact and consequences
3. **Solution framework** - Structured approach
4. **Implementation steps** - Clear, actionable guidance
5. **Best practices** - Do's and don'ts

**Structure Template:**
```
[Problem Statement]
[Why This Matters - Business Impact]
[Framework/Solution - Numbered Steps]
[Implementation Guidance]
[Key Takeaways]
```

### Closing Elements
1. **Clear call to action** - What to do next
2. **Resource offers** - Tools or additional content
3. **Engagement prompts** - Questions for discussion
4. **Summary reinforcement** - Key points restated
