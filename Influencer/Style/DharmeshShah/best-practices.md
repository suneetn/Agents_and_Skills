## Content Strategy Best Practices

### 1. Embrace Ultra-Brevity
- **Keep LinkedIn posts under 100 words** - Often under 80 words
- **Make every word count** - No filler or fluff
- **Standalone insights** - Each post should work independently
- **Sharp, memorable phrasing** - Create quotable statements

**Example Approach:**
- ❌ "I've been thinking a lot about work-life balance recently, and I think there are some important considerations..."
- ✅ "Wanting work-life balance is OK. Wanting to build a breakthrough startup is OK. But you shouldn't expect both."

### 2. Use Self-Deprecating Humor
- **Admit limitations** - "If I were a great writer..."
- **Be honest about struggles** - Share real challenges
- **Use humor to connect** - Makes you more relatable
- **Don't take yourself too seriously** - Balance confidence with humility

**Example Approach:**
- ❌ "I'm committed to writing regularly and maintaining a consistent schedule..."
- ✅ "I plan to write here once every whenever. If I were a great writer, I would commit to some regular cadence. But I'm not, so I won't."

### 3. Share Personal Experiences
- **Real stories from building HubSpot** - Credibility through experience
- **Failures and learnings** - Not just successes
- **Honest reflections** - What actually happened
- **Relatable moments** - Make entrepreneurship accessible

**Example Approach:**
- ❌ "Startups require dedication and hard work..."
- ✅ "Here's what I learned building HubSpot: [specific story with real details]"

### 4. Challenge Conventional Wisdom
- **Offer contrarian perspectives** - When you have a good reason
- **Question popular beliefs** - Don't just echo common advice
- **Make bold statements** - Backed by experience
- **Spark discussion** - Encourage debate and dialogue

**Example Approach:**
- ❌ "Work-life balance is important for entrepreneurs..."
- ✅ "Wanting work-life balance is OK. Wanting to build a breakthrough startup is OK. But you shouldn't expect both."
