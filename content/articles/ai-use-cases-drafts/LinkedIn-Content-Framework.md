# LinkedIn Content Framework & Templates

Based on analysis of successful LinkedIn creators (Reid Hoffman, Naomi Simson, Corporate Natalie, and tech leaders), here are proven frameworks and templates you can use.

## Core Frameworks

### 1. The Problem-Agitate-Solution (PAS) Framework

**Structure:**
1. **Problem**: State a relatable problem your audience faces
2. **Agitate**: Deepen the pain point (what happens if unsolved?)
3. **Solution**: Present your approach/method
4. **Proof**: Show results/impact
5. **Call to Action**: Engage readers

**Example Pattern:**
```
Problem: "I work with dozens of documents every week..."
Agitate: "Finding information meant scrolling through PDFs, asking colleagues..."
Solution: "I built a document intelligence system using RAG..."
Proof: "Questions that took 10-15 minutes now take seconds..."
CTA: "What AI use cases have you found valuable?"
```

### 2. The Story-Insight-Action (SIA) Framework

**Structure:**
1. **Story**: Personal anecdote or case study
2. **Insight**: What you learned or discovered
3. **Action**: What readers can do differently

**Example Pattern:**
```
Story: "Last month, I spent 2 hours searching through documents..."
Insight: "I realized that semantic search beats keyword matching..."
Action: "Here's how you can implement this..."
```

### 3. The Hook-Value-Engage (HVE) Framework

**Structure:**
1. **Hook**: Compelling opening line (question, bold statement, or surprising fact)
2. **Value**: Deliver actionable insights
3. **Engage**: End with question or call to action

**Example Hooks:**
- Bold statement: "Most AI demos are useless. Here's what actually works."
- Question: "What if you could query your entire document library in plain English?"
- Surprising fact: "I reduced document search time by 90% using a $0.01 per query solution."

## Writing Style Patterns

## LinkedIn-Specific Formatting Rules

### Paragraph Structure
