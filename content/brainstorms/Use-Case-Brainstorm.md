# LinkedIn Article: Use Case Brainstorming

Let's define which AI use cases you want to highlight in your LinkedIn article.

## Potential Use Cases (From Your Work)

### 1. Document Intelligence with RAG
**What it does**: Semantic search + AI synthesis for document queries
**Problem**: Finding info across dozens of documents
**Impact**: 10-15 min → seconds, $0.01/query
**Learning**: Citations are critical for trust

### 2. Natural Language Query for Org Analytics
**What it does**: Plain English → database queries
**Problem**: Complex SQL/filter UIs for non-technical users
**Impact**: 85%+ success rate, <3 sec response
**Learning**: Prompt engineering > coding edge cases

### 3. Context-Aware Query Rewriting
**What it does**: Handles follow-up questions with conversation context
**Problem**: Users reference previous context ("What about Bangalore?")
**Impact**: 30% → 20% refinement rate
**Learning**: Small UX improvements compound

### 4. AI Answer Synthesis
**What it does**: Perplexity-style answers from document chunks
**Problem**: Raw excerpts vs synthesized insights
**Impact**: Better UX, actionable insights
**Learning**: Synthesis layer transforms search into intelligence

### 5. Smart Query Routing
**What it does**: LLM decides filter UI vs direct execution
**Problem**: One-size-fits-all query handling
**Impact**: Better UX for different query types
**Learning**: Let LLM make routing decisions

### 6. Agent Systems for Analysis
**What it does**: Specialized agents for data analysis
**Problem**: Complex analysis workflows
**Impact**: Automated insights
**Learning**: Agent specialization > general AI

## Recommended Combinations

### Option A: The "Three Pillars" (Current)
1. Document Intelligence (RAG)
2. Natural Language Query
3. Context-Aware Rewriting

**Pros**: Shows progression, covers different domains
**Cons**: Query rewriting might feel like a subset of NL Query

### Option B: The "Full Stack"
1. Document Intelligence (RAG)
2. Natural Language Query
3. AI Answer Synthesis

**Pros**: Shows complete document intelligence pipeline
**Cons**: Synthesis might feel like part of RAG

### Option C: The "Different Domains"
1. Document Intelligence (RAG)
2. Natural Language Query (Org Analytics)
3. Agent Systems (Analysis)

**Pros**: Shows breadth across different problem domains
**Cons**: Agent systems might need more explanation

### Option D: The "Progression Story"
1. Started with: Simple keyword search
2. Added: Semantic search (RAG)
3. Enhanced: AI synthesis + citations
4. Refined: Context-aware queries

**Pros**: Shows iteration and learning
**Cons**: Might feel like one use case broken down
