# Most Productive AI Use Cases for 2025

2025 was a game-changing year for AI. The improvements in capabilities and use cases were staggering, even overwhelming. As I am sure for most of you, I experimented with applying it to different use cases. Here's what really worked for me:

Three use cases delivered real productivity gains (not an exhaustive list):

1. **Voice Mode During Commutes** - I feed documents into ChatGPT at the start of my drive, then have a conversation across the topic using voice mode. I blend existing research with my original thinking. By the end of my 45-minute commute, I typically have a ready-to-go document. I use this for strategy, brainstorming, and even performance reviews. Voice turns dead time into productive work.



2. **Cursor as Personal Assistant** - I use Cursor for non-coding tasks: research, writing, organization. Cursor's file search works like RAG, so I can pull up information locally and edit it directly. Everything is stored in markdown files, organized by Cursor, then viewed in Obsidian. The bonus: MD files upload to Google Docs perfectly formatted with one-click conversion. All my work lives in one searchable, editable system.



3. **Claude Skills** - Anthropic released Claude Skills as modular capabilities that extend Claude functionality. They feel natural and load automatically when needed. Some are pre-made from Anthropic (like PowerPoint). Others I've built for personal use, like stock analysis. I use skills for research, data analysis, design, and more. The game-changer: I made them work with cursor rules, even with non-Claude models, giving me the same capabilities across platforms.



The pattern I've found: Focus on problems you actually have, not flashy demos. Start narrow. Measure impact.
